# TRIBLANK: Multiple Entity Blanking for Relation Learning

## Abstract

Efforts in sentence and document level rela- tion extraction (RE) have often depended on predefined schema or knowledge graphs (KG) to develop mappings from text to relations, or to develop extendable textual representa- tions. However, due to variations in KGs, it becomes difficult to develop a general relation extractor that can perform well on arbitrary re- lations. Soares et al., 2019 [9] leverage re- cent work in contextual word representations to construct task-agnostic relation representa- tions. In this work, we build on their "Match- ing the Blanks" (MTB) training methodology by replacing entities in sets of three in a given example and task our model to identify rela- tions between pairs of blanked entities. We evaluate our model, TRIBLANK, on the Do- cRED [11] dataset. Our results showcase the difficulty of identifying semantic relations in the absence of contextual entities.
